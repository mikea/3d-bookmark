3d-bookmark
=======

Simple bookmark. The bookmark is created by "simulating" laser path in 2d mirrored box. 

While working on something else I got frustrated by OpenSCAD programming ability.
In this project I prototyped small Scala DSL for OpenSCAD. I eventually plan to extract
it to a separate library.
